			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p>
			<pre>&#9;</pre>My name is Ethan Desilets and I have a passion for computers. I would describe myself as a driven, hardworking, and determined individual. For as long as I can remember, I have always been curious about how things function and operate. When I was younger I was always playing with a screwdriver, taking my electronics apart and trying to determine how they functioned. This desire to understand how many things around me worked followed me throughout my schooling.
			</p>
			<p>
			<pre>&#9;</pre>I attended Blackstone Valley Regional Vocational High School where I pursued curriculum in metal fabrication. While in high school, I was part of the robotics team and this is where I found a deep passion for electronics and computers. Sure I loved fabricating and creating parts for the robot, but I found myself more intrigued by the programming of the machine. This program introduced me to Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) which I further pursued at Quinsigamond Community College. It is here that I received a certificate in CAD and began working in the field. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<pre>&#9;</pre>While at my first CAD job a very interesting opportunity was presented to me. At this job there was a web portal that was connected to Verizon&lsquo;s Oracle SQL database. It was my task to create queries that assisted in making a 3-4 hour job into a 2 minute process. After receiving little recognition from upper management I left in pursuit of a more supportive work environment that would allow me to learn from others. I am currently employed by a security equipment installation company that encourages the pursuit of my interests. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<pre>&#9;</pre>In my quest for knowledge in the world of technology I have done everything in my power to educate myself. This self-education began when I purchased a Raspberry PI in order to become more proficient in Linux systems. I have also participated in multiple online code schools that have expanded my knowledge of Ubuntu, Git-Hub, and other programming environments. I recently created an IOT (internet of things) project. The goal of this system is to create a wireless boiler temperature monitor to be used on external boilers. The hardware I chose for this project is an ESP8266 chip that is programmed by the Arduino IDE to read two thermometers and control 8 relays. The data is sent via MQTT protocol to my Raspberry PI which is a MQTT Broker with "Node.js" installed. The raspberry PI hosts the web page which contains CSS, jQuery, and html. I have not yet set up a DNS for my external IP. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<pre>&#9;</pre>I know that the next step towards a successful future for me is attendance at General Academy. I want to work with my passion every day and enjoy what I do. I am prepared to work hard and succeed at your academic institution. I am ready to change my career and my life. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and I look forward to hearing from you.
